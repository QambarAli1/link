    <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p>
        Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that
        <br><br>
        happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform
        <br><br>
        well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or 'devs', do this by
        <br><br>
        using a variety of coding languages.

    <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
    <p>
        <b>HTML</b> Stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." HTML is the language used to create webpages.
        <br><br>
        "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language"
        <br><br>
        refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.
    </p>
    <br><br>



    <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is used to format the layout of a webpage.
        <br><br>
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between
        <br><br>
        elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or
        <br><br>
        background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen
        <br><br>
        sizes, and much more!
    </p>
    <br><br>



    <h2 id="js">JavaSCript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was
        <br><br>
        originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive
        <br><br>
        elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is
        <br><br>
        more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed
        <br><br>
        by Sun Microsystems.
    </p>
    <br><br>




    <h2 id="react">REACT</h2>
    <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building
        <br><br>
        user interfaces. It's 'V' in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based
        <br><br>
        front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.
