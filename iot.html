        <h1>INTERNET OF THINGS</h1>
        <P>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that 
            <br><br>
            are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting
            <br><br>
            and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range
            <br><br>
            from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 
            <br><br>
            billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 
            <br><br>
            billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.
