        <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
        <P>
            Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled 
            <br><br>
            robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently 
            <br><br>
            applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes 
            <br><br>
            characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, 
            <br><br>
            or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, 
            <br><br>
            it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as,
             <br><br>
            for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great 
             <br><br>
            proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory
             <br><br>
            capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains
             <br><br>
            or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained
             <br><br>
            the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks,
             <br><br>
            so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as 
             <br><br>
            medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.
